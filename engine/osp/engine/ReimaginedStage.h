/**
    The bus part of Original <-> Reimagined (spec §12; shaping system v1.0 §47): a
    sympathetic resonator bank tuned to the source's partials and body peaks (plus a bank
    a fifth above towards the far end), re-excited by whatever is played, and towards the
    far end two formant peaks that wander slowly (spectral evolution: the instrument's
    vowel keeps changing). The per-voice part of Reimagined (shorter continuation,
    saturation, doubling, granular continuation, drift) lives in the voices.

    One implementation, several instances: the PostProcessor's (the shared stage every
    session made before per-layer routing uses, fed the layers' power-weighted amount) and
    one per layer (per-layer routing: each layer's own amount on its own signal, before
    the mix). The amount is smoothed, so moving it never clicks.

    prepare() is not real-time safe; everything else is (no allocation).
